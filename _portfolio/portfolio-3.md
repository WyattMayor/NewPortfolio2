## Project Description

Participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU). This program focused on the critical challenge of autonomous driving: improving the accuracy of traffic sign recognition under varied lighting conditions, particularly those affected by shadows. Recognizing that shadows can significantly impair the classification of traffic signs—a scenario with potentially hazardous outcomes—our research aimed to develop and refine preprocessing methodologies to mitigate these effects.
