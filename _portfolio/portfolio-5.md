By constructing a hierarchical network representation, we aim to extract valuable social media insights based on specific product categories. Our model enables accurate and insightful analysis, helping businesses make informed decisions in a complex marketing landscape. The framework uses data mining techniques to determine the best social media platforms for advertising specific products, enhancing targeted marketing strategies.
